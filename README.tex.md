# Intro
Welcome to **onepagepapers**! Here I will be sharing at least one summary each week of a paper I've read, either for research or casually.

I will attempt to keep the essence of the paper alive in each summary and limit it to, of course, one page of a PDF. I am no expert on many of these sub-fields of machine learning, and as a result **I will borrow language and notation generously from the original papers**.

The goal is to create a resource that contains the key contributions and results of a paper, allowing myself and other researchers to more **easily draw connections between papers** that have similar ideas or complementary methods.
